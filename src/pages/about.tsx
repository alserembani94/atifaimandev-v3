        <p>
          I am a frontend developer enthusiast, and love to deliver a
          pixel-perfect creation. Well, I hereby declare that I am proficient in
          CSS. Not just that, I am in love (and still) in React, and have been
          into it since 2018.
          <br />
          <br />
          And so, I start to develop this very portfolio as my canvas, to
          showcase my styling skills. My curiosity is always on, and I am always
          looking for new challenges to solve. The accessibilities,
          internationalization, and performance are in my bucket list.
          <br />
          <br />
          I also love to share my knowledge, and occasionally write articles.
          Well, initially I just want to record my process of learning, and end
          up discovered that I love to teach. One day, I hope I have my own
          course so anyone can benefit from it as well.
          <br />
          <br />
          By the way, my portfolio is open-source, so you are welcome to{" "}
